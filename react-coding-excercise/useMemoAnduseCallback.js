Both React.useMemo and React.useCallback receives a function as its first argument and a dependencies array as the second one.

the fooFunction without calling it.

Every time the user clicks on the button, the state of count1 changes causing the App to rerender both counters which is known 
as unnecessary re-render. However, we expect only the counter1 to be rerendered since nothing has changed with the counter2. 
In reality, both counters get rerendered.

How can we address this issue? ðŸ¤” Well, React.memo is our answer. 
All we need to do is to wrap our Counter component within React.memo
